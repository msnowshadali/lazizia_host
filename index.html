        <h2>About Us more</h2>

        <p> Eating real food should be more accessible, because when we dine well we live well. This has been the
            philosophy behind Lazizia which is based out in Bangalore, India. Today, we’re a leading driver of the
            contemporary grass-fed animals. Our focus is simple, we produce the best meat and we’re involved every step
            of
            the way. With a team of dedicated professionals, our effort toward quality and sustainability is at the
            forefront of the process. Close attention is paid to cutting, sealing and boxing of the meat. We only use
            natural enzymes and the meat is all fresh. Meat by Lazizia is audited twice and each box of Lazizia meat
            is handled with great care.</p><br/>

        <p>
            With us, expect classic butchery, and with every mouthful expect exceptional quality. We're masters of meat
            on
            the bone, to relax the meat to tenderness and ensure intense, savoury flavor. All our prime meat is cut
            fresh
            specifically for your order and not before, for optimum quality. You click, we cut, then dispatch to your
            delivery address. We don't settle for sending frozen meat. Instead everything is dispatched from our Master
            Butchers direct to your door, preserving the integrity of our meat ready for home cooking or freezing.</p>
