<p>Eating real food should be more accessible, because when we dine well we live well. This has been the philosophy behind RednWhites which is based out in Bangalore, India. Today, we’re a leading driver of the contemporary grass-fed animals. Our focus is simple, we produce the best meat and we’re involved every step of the way. With a team of dedicated professionals, our effort toward quality and sustainability is at the forefront of the process. Close attention is paid to cutting, sealing and boxing of the meat. We only use natural enzymes and the meat is all fresh. Meat by RednWhites is audited twice and each box of RednWhites meat is handled with great care.</p>

<p>
With us, expect classic butchery, and with every mouthful expect exceptional quality. We're masters of meat on the bone, to relax the meat to tenderness and ensure intense, savoury flavor. All our prime meat is cut fresh specifically for your order and not before, for optimum quality. You click, we cut, then dispatch to your delivery address. We don't settle for sending frozen meat. Instead everything is dispatched from our Master Butchers direct to your door, preserving the integrity of our meat ready for home cooking or freezing.</p>
